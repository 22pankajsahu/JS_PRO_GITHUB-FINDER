## Features

- Search for GitHub profiles by username.
- Display user's name, profile picture, bio, and GitHub statistics.
- Toggle between dark mode and light mode.

## How it Works

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the application includes a search form and a user card container. The user card container is initially populated with a loader message.

### CSS Styling

CSS styles are used to define the appearance of the application, including the search form, user card, and dark mode toggle switch.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code handles the following functionality:

1. User enters a GitHub username and submits the search form.
2. The application fetches data from the GitHub API using the entered username.
3. If the user is found, their information is displayed in a user card.
4. If the user is not found, an error message is displayed.
5. Users can toggle between dark mode and light mode using the switch.
